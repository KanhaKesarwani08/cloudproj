# Budget Tracker FastAPI Application - Code Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Budget Tracker FastAPI application codebase. The application is a simple budget tracking tool with user authentication, expense management, and a database backend, designed to be deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It uses a FastAPI backend with Python, a PostgreSQL database (intended for Cloud SQL), and a plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend. Authentication is handled via a custom JWT (JSON Web Token) implementation.

## 3. Root Directory Files

### 3.1. `README.md`
*   **Purpose**: Provides a general overview of the project, its features, setup instructions for local development, and a guide for deploying to Google Cloud Platform. It's the first point of entry for anyone new to the project.
*   **Key Contents**: Project title, description, features list, project structure, GCP setup guide (including Firebase Authentication if it were used, and Cloud SQL), and local development steps.

### 3.2. `requirements.txt`
*   **Purpose**: Lists all Python package dependencies required for the project to run. This file is used by `pip` to install these dependencies.
*   **Key Dependencies and Roles**:
    *   `fastapi`: The main web framework for building the API.
    *   `uvicorn[standard]`: ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
    *   `jinja2`: Templating engine for rendering HTML pages.
    *   `python-multipart`: For handling HTML form data (e.g., file uploads, standard forms).
    *   `SQLAlchemy`: Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interactions.
    *   `psycopg2-binary`: PostgreSQL adapter for Python, allowing SQLAlchemy to communicate with PostgreSQL databases.
    *   `google-cloud-sql-python-connector`: Google Cloud SQL Python Connector for securely connecting to Cloud SQL instances, especially from environments like Cloud Run.
    *   `pydantic-settings`: Used for managing application settings and configurations, often loaded from environment variables or .env files.
    *   `passlib[bcrypt]`: For hashing and verifying passwords securely. `bcrypt` is the chosen hashing algorithm.
    *   `python-jose[cryptography]`: For encoding, decoding, and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). `cryptography` provides the cryptographic backend.
    *   `firebase-admin`: (Currently installed but unused for authentication after pivoting to custom JWT. Might be useful if other Firebase services are integrated later.)

### 3.3. `Dockerfile`
*   **Purpose**: Contains instructions to build a Docker container image for the application. This is essential for deployment to containerized environments like Google Cloud Run.
*   **Key Stages**:
    1.  Uses an official Python slim image as the base (`python:3.9-slim`).
    2.  Sets the working directory to `/app` in the container.
    3.  Copies `requirements.txt` and installs dependencies using `pip`.
    4.  Copies the application code (`app/` directory) into the container.
    5.  Exposes port `8000` (the port the application listens on).
    6.  Sets environment variables for the application module, host, and port.
    7.  Specifies the command to run the application using `gunicorn` with `uvicorn` workers, which is a production-ready setup.

### 3.4. `.gitignore`
*   **Purpose**: Specifies intentionally untracked files and directories that Git should ignore. This prevents committing unnecessary or sensitive files to the repository.
*   **Key Exclusions**: Python bytecode files (`__pycache__`, `*.pyc`), virtual environment directories (`venv/`, `.env/`), IDE/editor-specific files, OS-generated files, secret files (like `serviceAccountKey.json` or `.env` files), log files, and build artifacts.

## 4. `app/` Directory - Core Application Logic

### 4.1. `app/__init__.py`
*   **Purpose**: An empty file that makes the `app` directory a Python package, allowing its modules to be imported.

### 4.2. `app/main.py`
*   **Purpose**: The main entry point for the FastAPI application. It initializes the FastAPI app, includes routers, sets up static file serving, configures Jinja2 templates, and handles application startup events.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   `FastAPI()` app instance initialization.
    *   `StaticFiles` mounting for serving CSS and JS from `app/static/`.
    *   `Jinja2Templates` setup for rendering HTML from `app/templates/`.
    *   `@app.on_event("startup")`: An event handler that calls `create_db_tables()` when the application starts.
    *   `create_db_tables()`: Function to create database tables based on SQLAlchemy models (defined in `app/db/models.py`) using `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)`. This is useful for development to auto-create tables.
    *   Inclusion of API routers (`auth.router`, `expenses.router`).
    *   Root endpoint (`/`) serving `index.html`.
    *   Redirects for `/login` and `/dashboard` to their correct router paths.
    *   A `/health` check endpoint.
    *   `if __name__ == "__main__":`: Allows running the app directly with `uvicorn` for local development.

### 4.3. `app/core/` Sub-directory

#### 4.3.1. `app/core/config.py`
*   **Purpose**: Manages application settings and configurations using `pydantic-settings`. It loads settings from environment variables, providing defaults where appropriate.
*   **Key Settings**:
    *   `PROJECT_NAME`, `API_V1_STR`.
    *   Database connection parameters: `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`.
    *   `INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME`: For connecting to Google Cloud SQL via the Python connector.
    *   `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: Dynamically constructed database connection string based on the provided parameters, prioritizing Cloud SQL connector if `INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME` is set, then direct PostgreSQL connection, and falling back to SQLite for basic testing if incomplete.
    *   JWT settings: `SECRET_KEY` (critical for security, should be set via environment variable in production), `ALGORITHM` (e.g., "HS256"), `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`.
*   **Environment Variables**: This file heavily relies on environment variables for configuration, which is a best practice for security and flexibility across different environments (dev, staging, prod). Essential variables to set:
    *   For Database: `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME` (and `DB_PORT` if not default 5432). Or `INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME` for Cloud SQL.
    *   For JWT: `SECRET_KEY` (must be a strong, unique key). `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` (optional, defaults to 30).
    *   For Firebase Admin SDK (if used for other purposes): `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (path to service account JSON file).

#### 4.3.2. `app/core/security.py`
*   **Purpose**: Provides security-related utility functions, specifically for password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Token) handling for custom authentication.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   **Password Hashing**:
        *   `pwd_context`: A `CryptContext` instance from `passlib` configured to use `bcrypt` for hashing.
        *   `verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password)`: Verifies a plain password against a stored hashed password.
        *   `get_password_hash(password)`: Hashes a plain password.
    *   **JWT Handling**:
        *   Uses `SECRET_KEY`, `ALGORITHM`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` from `app.core.config.settings`.
        *   `create_access_token(data, expires_delta)`: Creates a JWT. The `data` dictionary (typically containing `{"sub": user_email}`) is encoded into the token.
        *   `verify_access_token(token, credentials_exception)`: Decodes and verifies a JWT. Raises the provided `credentials_exception` (an `HTTPException`) if the token is invalid, expired, or crucial claims are missing. Returns the token payload (claims) on success.

#### 4.3.3. `app/core/firebase_auth.py`
*   **Purpose (Historical)**: This file was originally created to handle Firebase Admin SDK initialization and Firebase ID token verification when the project was intended to use Firebase Authentication.
*   **Current Status**: **Unused for authentication.** The project has pivoted to a custom JWT-based authentication system where user credentials are stored in the application's database.
*   **Recommendation**: This file can likely be **deleted** to avoid confusion, unless there are plans to use other Firebase services that might require the Firebase Admin SDK. If kept, it should be clearly marked as not being part of the current authentication flow.

### 4.4. `app/db/` Sub-directory

#### 4.4.1. `app/db/__init__.py`
*   **Purpose**: Makes the `db` directory a Python package.

#### 4.4.2. `app/db/session.py`
*   **Purpose**: Sets up the database connection using SQLAlchemy. It initializes the database engine, creates a session factory (`SessionLocal`), and provides a dependency (`get_db`) for FastAPI routes to obtain database sessions. It also defines the `Base` for declarative SQLAlchemy models.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   `engine`: The SQLAlchemy engine, configured based on `settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`.
        *   Includes logic to use the `google-cloud-sql-python-connector` if `settings.INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME` is set, allowing secure connections to Cloud SQL (e.g., from Cloud Run) using IAM authentication or private IP. It defines a `get_conn` function passed as a `creator` to `create_engine` for this purpose.
        *   Falls back to a direct PostgreSQL connection string or a local SQLite database if Cloud SQL is not configured.
    *   `SessionLocal`: A `sessionmaker` factory that creates database sessions bound to the `engine`.
    *   `Base`: An instance of `declarative_base()` that SQLAlchemy ORM models will inherit from.
    *   `get_db()`: A FastAPI dependency (generator function) that provides a database session to path operation functions. It ensures the session is closed after the request is processed.
    *   Includes commented-out `create_tables()` function (actual creation is now handled in `app/main.py` on startup).

#### 4.4.3. `app/db/models.py`
*   **Purpose**: Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) models, which represent the database tables (`users` and `expenses`) and their schemas.
*   **Key Models**:
    *   `User(Base)`:
        *   Table name: `users`.
        *   Columns: `id` (Integer, primary key), `email` (String, unique, for login), `full_name` (String, optional), `hashed_password` (String, stores the bcrypt-hashed password), `is_active` (Boolean), `created_at`, `updated_at` (DateTime timestamps).
        *   Relationships: `expenses` (one-to-many relationship with the `Expense` model).
    *   `Expense(Base)`:
        *   Table name: `expenses`.
        *   Columns: `id` (Integer, primary key), `description` (String), `amount` (Float), `category` (String), `expense_date` (Date), `owner_id` (Integer, foreign key referencing `users.id`), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
        *   Relationships: `owner` (many-to-one relationship with the `User` model).

### 4.5. `app/models/` Sub-directory (Pydantic Schemas)

#### 4.5.1. `app/models/__init__.py`
*   **Purpose**: Makes the `models` (Pydantic schemas) directory a Python package.

#### 4.5.2. `app/models/user.py`
*   **Purpose**: Defines Pydantic schemas for user data validation, serialization, and API request/response bodies related to users. These are distinct from SQLAlchemy ORM models.
*   **Key Schemas**:
    *   `UserCreate`: For creating a new user (input). Expects `email`, `password` (plain text), `full_name`.
    *   `UserLogin`: For user login (input). Expects `email`, `password`.
    *   `UserBase`: A base schema for user data fields (output, excludes password).
    *   `UserInDB`: Represents user data as stored in/retrieved from the database (extends `UserBase`, includes `id`). `Config.from_attributes = True` allows creating from ORM objects.
    *   `User`: Represents a user in API responses (similar to `UserInDB`). `Config.from_attributes = True`.
    *   `Token`: Represents the JWT access token returned on successful login. Contains `access_token` and `token_type`.
    *   `TokenData`: Represents the data encoded within a JWT (e.g., `email` as the subject).

#### 4.5.3. `app/models/expense.py`
*   **Purpose**: Defines Pydantic schemas for expense data validation, serialization, and API request/response bodies.
*   **Key Schemas**:
    *   `ExpenseBase`: Base fields for an expense (`description`, `amount`, `category`, `expense_date`).
    *   `ExpenseCreate`: For creating a new expense (input, inherits from `ExpenseBase`).
    *   `ExpenseUpdate`: For updating an expense (input, all fields optional).
    *   `ExpenseInDB`: Represents expense data as stored in/retrieved from the database (extends `ExpenseBase`, includes `id`, `owner_id`, `created_at`). `Config.from_attributes = True`.

### 4.6. `app/routers/` Sub-directory (FastAPI Routers)

#### 4.6.1. `app/routers/__init__.py`
*   **Purpose**: Makes the `routers` directory a Python package.

#### 4.6.2. `app/routers/auth.py`
*   **Purpose**: Handles authentication-related API endpoints, including user registration and login (token issuance).
*   **Key Components**:
    *   `APIRouter` instance with prefix `/auth`.
    *   `oauth2_scheme`: An `OAuth2PasswordBearer` instance, specifying `/auth/token` as the URL client uses to obtain the token. Used by FastAPI's dependency system to extract tokens from the `Authorization` header.
    *   `/login` (GET): Serves the `login.html` page.
    *   `/register` (GET): Serves the `register.html` page.
    *   `/register` (POST):
        *   Accepts `UserCreate` schema (email, password, full_name).
        *   Checks if the email is already registered using `user_service.get_user_by_email`.
        *   Creates the user using `user_service.create_user` (which hashes the password).
        *   Returns the created user's data (as `user_schema.User`).
    *   `/token` (POST):
        *   Expects `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data with `username` (which is the email) and `password`, via `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()`.
        *   Authenticates the user using `user_service.authenticate_user`.
        *   If authentication is successful, creates a JWT access token using `security.create_access_token` (with user's email as the subject `sub`).
        *   Returns the token as `user_schema.Token` (containing `access_token` and `token_type`).
    *   `get_current_user_from_token(token, db)`: An internal dependency that verifies the JWT from the `Authorization: Bearer` header using `security.verify_access_token` and fetches the user from the database by the email in the token's `sub` claim.
    *   `get_current_active_user(current_user)`: A FastAPI dependency that relies on `get_current_user_from_token`. It ensures the fetched user is active. This is the primary dependency used to protect other routes.
    *   `/users/me` (GET): An example protected route that returns the profile of the currently authenticated user using `get_current_active_user`.
    *   `/logout` (GET): Primarily a client-side action for JWTs (client deletes the token). This endpoint provides a server-side route for consistency and redirects to home.

#### 4.6.3. `app/routers/expenses.py`
*   **Purpose**: Handles all API endpoints related to expense management (CRUD operations).
*   **Key Components**:
    *   `APIRouter` instance with prefix `/expenses`.
    *   **Protected Routes**: The entire router is protected by `dependencies=[Depends(get_current_active_user)]` from `app.routers.auth`, meaning all expense endpoints require a valid JWT.
    *   `/dashboard` (GET):
        *   Serves the `dashboard.html` page.
        *   Fetches and passes the current user's expenses (from `expense_service.get_expenses_for_user`) and email to the template.
    *   `/add` (POST):
        *   Handles new expense submission from a form.
        *   Takes `description`, `amount`, `category`, and optional `expense_date_str` as form data.
        *   Uses the authenticated `current_user.id` as `owner_id`.
        *   Creates the expense using `expense_service.create_expense`.
        *   Redirects to `/expenses/dashboard` upon successful creation.
    *   **API-style JSON Endpoints**: These are suitable for a JavaScript frontend that handles UI updates dynamically:
        *   `/` (GET, `api_read_expenses`): Lists expenses for the authenticated user with pagination (Pydantic `ExpenseInDB` models in response).
        *   `/{expense_id}` (GET, `api_read_expense`): Fetches a single expense by ID for the authenticated user.
        *   `/{expense_id}` (PUT, `api_update_expense`): Updates an existing expense for the authenticated user.
        *   `/{expense_id}` (DELETE, `api_delete_expense`): Deletes an expense for the authenticated user.
    *   All API endpoints use `expense_schema.ExpenseInDB.model_validate(db_expense)` to convert SQLAlchemy ORM objects to Pydantic schemas for the JSON response, ensuring consistent data structure.

### 4.7. `app/services/` Sub-directory

#### 4.7.1. `app/services/__init__.py`
*   **Purpose**: Makes the `services` directory a Python package.

#### 4.7.2. `app/services/user_service.py`
*   **Purpose**: Contains the business logic for user-related operations, acting as an intermediary between the API routers and the database models.
*   **Key Functions**:
    *   `get_user_by_email(db, email)`: Retrieves a user from the database by their email.
    *   `get_user_by_id(db, user_id)`: Retrieves a user by their primary key ID.
    *   `create_user(db, user_in)`:
        *   Takes `user_schema.UserCreate` Pydantic model as input.
        *   Hashes the plain password using `security.get_password_hash`.
        *   Creates a new `db_models.User` SQLAlchemy object and saves it to the database.
    *   `authenticate_user(db, email, password)`:
        *   Fetches a user by email.
        *   Verifies if the user exists, is active, and if the provided plain password matches the stored hashed password (using `security.verify_password`).
        *   Returns the `db_models.User` object if authentication is successful, otherwise `None`.

#### 4.7.3. `app/services/budget_service.py`
*   **Purpose**: Contains the business logic for expense-related operations. (Conceptually, this acts as an `expense_service`).
*   **Key Functions**:
    *   `get_expense_by_id(db, expense_id, user_id)`: Fetches a specific expense by its ID, ensuring it belongs to the specified `user_id`.
    *   `get_expenses_for_user(db, user_id, skip, limit)`: Retrieves a list of expenses for a given `user_id` with pagination. Orders by expense date and creation date.
    *   `create_expense(db, expense, user_id)`:
        *   Takes `expense_schema.ExpenseCreate` Pydantic model and `user_id` as input.
        *   Creates a new `db_models.Expense` SQLAlchemy object, linking it to the `user_id`.
        *   Defaults `expense_date` to today if not provided.
        *   Saves the expense to the database.
    *   `update_expense(db, expense_id, expense_update_data, user_id)`:
        *   Takes `expense_id`, `expense_schema.ExpenseUpdate` Pydantic model, and `user_id`.
        *   Fetches the existing expense, ensuring it belongs to the user.
        *   Updates its fields based on the `expense_update_data` (only non-None fields).
        *   Saves changes to the database.
    *   `delete_expense(db, expense_id, user_id)`:
        *   Takes `expense_id` and `user_id`.
        *   Fetches the expense, ensuring it belongs to the user.
        *   Deletes the expense from the database. Returns `True` on success, `False` if not found.

### 4.8. `app/static/` Sub-directory

#### 4.8.1. `app/static/css/style.css`
*   **Purpose**: Provides basic CSS styling for the HTML pages to give the application a clean and functional appearance.
*   **Key Styles**: Includes basic reset, typography, layout for header, main content, forms, lists, and footer.

#### 4.8.2. `app/static/js/script.js`
*   **Purpose**: Contains all frontend JavaScript logic for user interaction, authentication handling (custom JWT), API communication, and dynamic content updates.
*   **Key Functionality**:
    *   **Token Management**:
        *   `TOKEN_KEY`: Constant for the `localStorage` key used to store the JWT.
        *   `storeToken(token)`, `getToken()`, `removeToken()`: Functions to manage the JWT in `localStorage`.
    *   **UI Element References**: Gets references to various HTML elements for manipulation.
    *   **Helper Functions**:
        *   `showAuthMessage(element, message, isError)`: Displays messages (e.g., errors, success) in specified auth-related paragraph elements.
        *   `fetchWithAuth(url, options)`: A crucial helper for making API calls.
            *   Retrieves the JWT from `localStorage`.
            *   Adds the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to requests if a token exists.
            *   Sets `Content-Type` appropriately (handles JSON and FormData/URLSearchParams).
            *   Performs the `fetch` call.
            *   Handles response status, parses JSON, and throws errors with details if the API call fails.
    *   **UI State Management**:
        *   `updateNavUI(isLoggedIn, userEmail)`: Updates navigation links (Login, Register, Dashboard, Logout) and user info display based on login state.
    *   **Authentication Flow**:
        *   `checkLoginState()`: Called on page load.
            *   Checks if a token exists in `localStorage`.
            *   If token exists, attempts to fetch the current user's profile from `/auth/users/me` to validate the token.
            *   Updates UI accordingly. Redirects to dashboard if logged in and on login/register page, or to login if on dashboard and not logged in/token invalid.
        *   **Login Form (`loginForm`)**:
            *   On submit, prevents default form action.
            *   Sends email (as `username`) and password to `/auth/token` (as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).
            *   On success, stores the received JWT using `storeToken()` and calls `checkLoginState()` (which then handles UI updates and redirection).
            *   Displays errors from the API.
        *   **Registration Form (`registerForm`)**:
            *   On submit, prevents default.
            *   Validates if passwords match.
            *   Sends email, full_name, and password to `/auth/register` (as JSON).
            *   On success, shows a message and redirects to the login page.
            *   Displays errors.
        *   **Logout Link (`navLogoutLink`)**:
            *   Removes the token using `removeToken()`.
            *   Updates UI and redirects to the home page.
    *   **Expense Management (Dashboard)**:
        *   `fetchAndDisplayExpenses()`:
            *   Called when the dashboard loads for a logged-in user.
            *   Makes a GET request to `/expenses/` (API endpoint) using `fetchWithAuth`.
            *   Dynamically populates the `#expenseList` `<ul>` with fetched expenses.
        *   **Expense Form (`expenseForm`)**:
            *   On submit, prevents default.
            *   Collects expense data (`description`, `amount`, `category`, `expense_date`).
            *   Sends data as `FormData` to `/expenses/add` (POST request) using `fetch` (with manual redirect handling because the backend redirects).
            *   Includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
            *   If the backend redirects (on successful add), the JS redirects the browser to the dashboard.
            *   Displays success/error messages.
    *   **Initial Page Load**: Calls `checkLoginState()` to set up the correct UI based on authentication status.

### 4.9. `app/templates/` Sub-directory (Jinja2 HTML Templates)

#### 4.9.1. `app/templates/index.html`
*   **Purpose**: The main landing page of the application.
*   **Structure**: Includes `partials/header.html` and `partials/footer.html`. Contains welcome messages and links to login/register.

#### 4.9.2. `app/templates/login.html`
*   **Purpose**: Provides the user login form.
*   **Structure**: Includes partials. Contains a `<form id="loginForm">` with fields for email (named `username` for `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`) and password. An error paragraph (`#authError`) is included for displaying login errors via JavaScript. Links to the registration page.

#### 4.9.3. `app/templates/register.html`
*   **Purpose**: Provides the new user registration form.
*   **Structure**: Includes partials. Contains a `<form id="registerForm">` with fields for email, full name (optional), password, and confirm password. A message paragraph (`#authMessage`) is for success/error feedback. Links to the login page.

#### 4.9.4. `app/templates/dashboard.html`
*   **Purpose**: The main page for authenticated users to manage and view their expenses.
*   **Structure**: Includes partials.
    *   **Add Expense Form (`#expenseForm`)**: Form to input new expense details (description, amount, category, date). A message paragraph (`#expenseMessage`) is for feedback.
    *   **Expense List (`#expenseListSection`, `#expenseList`)**: An unordered list (`<ul>`) where expenses fetched via JavaScript will be displayed. Includes a placeholder (`#noExpensesMessage`) if no expenses exist.
    *   **Spending Graph (`#spendingGraph`, `#myChart`)**: A `<canvas>` element intended for a chart (e.g., Chart.js), initially hidden. The JS would populate this.

#### 4.9.5. `app/templates/partials/header.html`
*   **Purpose**: A common header included in all main HTML pages.
*   **Structure**: Contains `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>` (with charset, viewport, title, CSS link), and the opening `<body>` and `<header>` tags.
    *   **Navigation (`<nav>`)**: Includes links for Home, Login (`#navLoginLink`), Register (`#navRegisterLink`), Dashboard (`#navDashboardLink`), and Logout (`#navLogoutLink`). The visibility of Login, Register, Dashboard, and Logout links, along with user info (`#userInfo`), is controlled by JavaScript based on authentication state.
    *   **Firebase SDKs**: **These should have been removed.** If they are still present, they are remnants of the previous Firebase authentication approach and are not used by the current custom JWT system.

#### 4.9.6. `app/templates/partials/footer.html`
*   **Purpose**: A common footer included in all main HTML pages.
*   **Structure**: Contains the closing `</main>`, `<footer>` content (copyright), the include for the main JavaScript file (`script.js`), and closing `</body>`, `</html>` tags.

## 5. Final Checks & Recommendations
*   **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables (for `SECRET_KEY` and database connection) are properly set up for both local development (e.g., in a `.env` file loaded by your shell or Pydantic, or directly exported) and in your GCP deployment environment (e.g., Cloud Run environment variables).
*   **Database Schema Migrations**: For production, consider using a database migration tool like Alembic (which integrates well with SQLAlchemy) to manage changes to your database schema over time, rather than relying solely on `Base.metadata.create_all()`.
*   **`firebase_auth.py`**: Review `app/core/firebase_auth.py`. If it's confirmed to be entirely unused, delete it to simplify the codebase.
*   **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling and user feedback on both the frontend and backend for a more robust application.
*   **Security**:
    *   Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is strong and kept secret.
    *   Consider adding rate limiting, input validation beyond Pydantic (if needed), and other security best practices.
    *   Regularly update dependencies.
*   **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests for backend services, routers, and potentially frontend logic.

This documentation should provide a solid understanding of the project's architecture and components.
